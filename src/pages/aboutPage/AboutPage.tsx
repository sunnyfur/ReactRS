      <h2>What is NFT?</h2>
      <p>
        An NFT is a digital asset that can come in the form of art, music, in-game items, videos,
        and more. They are bought and sold online, frequently with cryptocurrency, and they are
        generally encoded with the same underlying software as many cryptos.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although theyâ€™ve been around since 2014, NFTs are gaining notoriety now because they are
        becoming an increasingly popular way to buy and sell digital artwork. The market for NFTs
        was worth a staggering $41 billion in 2021 alone, an amount that is approaching the total
        value of the entire global fine art market.
